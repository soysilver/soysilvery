Understanding the Expectations and Challenges of Generative AI in Drafting Webtoons
============

- *This is a study that was recently rejected and is currently going through the resubmission process. The figures and details of the actual paper will be updated after it is published.*

This project was conducted at Ewha Womans University's Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory, and involved in-depth interviews with 16 webtoon writers and hands-on sessions with AI to draft their work. 
In the process, we explored the expectations that writers have of AI, the difficulties they face when creating with AI, and discussed their needs and directions for effective work support.
