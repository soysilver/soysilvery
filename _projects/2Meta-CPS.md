Building CPS for Prognostics and health management and simulation of turbomachinery with Unity 
============
CPS-Compressor is a web data parsing-based compressor system health monitoring and engineering data interpretation tool. The Meta-CPS project is part of a government assignment in Korea to develop a platform technology and operation management system for the condition diagnosis of variable fluid equipment design, and it predicts the optimal efficiency of operation through measurement and verification (M&V) techniques and performs monitoring including abnormal condition diagnosis for health prediction and management.

Optimizing Group Operations of Blowers
------------
Many industrial settings use multiple blowers (or compressors) to create the desired flow rate. Since each blower has a different detailed performance, selecting and running efficient blowers can save energy. This design uses artificial intelligence to predict the performance of blowers, and then derives the combination of blowers that meets the target flow rate while consuming the least power. 

It also displays real-time data and provides several health diagnostic tools. 

**My Contributions Are:**

- AI-based performance map to calculate the optimal operation combination for group-operated compressors
- TCP communication-driven database processing system
- ISO 10816-3-based vibration monitoring function
- Sohre's Chart-based condition diagnosis function
