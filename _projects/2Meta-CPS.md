Building CPS for Prognostics and health management and simulation of turbomachinery with Unity 
============
CPS-Compressor is a web data parsing-based compressor system health monitoring and engineering data interpretation tool.  The project is part of a government assignment in Korea to develop a platform technology and operation management system for the condition diagnosis of variable fluid equipment design, and it predicts the optimal efficiency of operation through measurement and verification (M&V) techniques and performs monitoring including abnormal condition diagnosis for health prediction and management. 

*This is an ongoing project, so we can't disclose too many details. I'll do my best to explain as much as I can. *

Optimizing Group Operations of Blowers
------------
산업 현장에서 원하는 유량을 만들어내기 위해 여러 대의 송풍기(내비는 압축기)를 사용하는 경우가 많다. 이때 송풍기별 세부 성능이 다르므로, 효율적인 송풍기를  

My Contributions Are:

- ISO 10816-3-based vibration monitoring function
- Sohre's Chart-based condition diagnosis function
- AI-based performance map to calculate the optimal operation combination for group-operated compressors
- TCP communication-driven database processing system
