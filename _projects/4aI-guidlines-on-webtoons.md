Understanding the Expectations and Challenges of Generative AI in Drafting Webtoons
============

This research investigates the task delegation trends of digital comic authors to generative AIs during the creation process. We observed 16 digital comic authors using generative AIs during the drafting stage. We categorized authors’ delegation levels and examined the extent of delegation, variations in AI usage, and calibration of delegation in co-creation. Our findings show that most authors delegate significant tasks to AI, with higher delegation linked to less time spent on creation and more detailed questions to AI. After co-creation, about 60% of authors adjusted their delegation levels, mostly calibrating to less delegation due to loss of agency and AI’s unoriginal outputs. We suggest strategies for calibrating delegation to an appropriate level, redefine trust in human-AI co-creation, and propose novel measurements for trust in these contexts. Our study provides insights into how authors can effectively collaborate with generative AIs, balance delegation, and navigate AI’s role in the creative process.
