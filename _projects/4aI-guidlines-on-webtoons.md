Understanding the Expectations and Challenges of Generative AI in Drafting Webtoons
============

*This is a study that was recently rejected and is currently going through the resubmission process. The figures and details of the actual paper will be updated after it is published.*

The drafting stage for webtoon authors involves developing the storyline and solidifying the character designs and images before serializing their webtoons. Given the excessive workload during the serialization process, enhancing quality in the drafting stage is crucial. Meanwhile, with advancements in generative AI, a Human-AI co-creation (HACO) environment has aided creators in their creation process. However, there is limited research on generative AI-based HACO for the webtoon drafting stage. To address the problem, we conducted interviews and hands-on AI sessions with 16 webtoon authors to explore their expectations of generative AI and the challenges they face using it in the process. Based on these findings, we discuss how generative AI can effectively support their work in the webtoon drafting stage. Our study lays the groundwork for effectively integrating generative AI-based HACO into the webtoon drafting stage.
