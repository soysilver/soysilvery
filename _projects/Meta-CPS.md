Building CPS for Prognostics and health management and simulation of turbomachinery with Unity 
============

이 프로젝트는 대한민국의 정부 과제의 일환으로 진행되었다. Meta-CPS는 압축기 시스템 상태 모니터링 및 엔지니어링 데이터 해석 툴
M&V(Measurement and Verification) 기법을 통해 운영 최적 효율을 예측하고, 건전성 예측 및 관리를 위한 이상 상태 진단 기능을 포함한 모니터링 프로그램

H2 Header
------------

My Contributions Are:

- Added ISO 10816-3-based vibration monitoring function
- Sohre's Chart-based condition diagnosis function
- Added AI-based performance map to calculate the optimal operation combination for group-operated compressors

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it by specifying the languagae after the start of a block (e.g. `~~~python`) which would look like :

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(i)
~~~

### An H3 header ###

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Some footnote text.

Tables can look like this:

| Header 1 | Header 2                   | Header 3 |
|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:--------:|
| data1a   | Data is longer than header | 1        |
| d1b      | add a cell                 |          |
| lorem    | ipsum                      | 3        |
|          | empty outside cells        |          |
| skip     |                            | 5        |
| six      | Morbi purus                | 6        |


A horizontal rule follows.

Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.

oranges
  : Citrus!

tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term and  its definition to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block" (note how whitespace is honored):

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

Inline math equation: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line like so:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$
