Hello! I am an intern researcher working in [ROMIN](https://romin.re.kr/){:target="_blank"} lab at [Korea Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do){:target="_blank"}. I work on optimization with artificial intelligence in a variety of interdisciplinary areas, from rotational mechanics to chemistry.
