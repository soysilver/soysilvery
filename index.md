Hello! I am an intern researcher working at [ROMIN](https://romin.re.kr/){:target="_blank"} lab of the [Korea Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do){:target="_blank"}. I work on optimization with artificial intelligence in a variety of interdisciplinary areas, from rotational mechanics to chemistry. 

Before KIST, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Ewha Womans University](https://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewhaen/index.do){:target="_blank"}, along with a minor in Chemistry & Nanoscience. I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant at [HCILab@EWHA](https://hcil-ewha.github.io/homepage/){:target="_blank"} and as an intern developer at [Blue Solutions](http://www.bluechain.kr/main#){:target="_blank"}, a South Korean startup that develops system software.

### Research Interests:
##### 1. Optimization
   : I use optimization in various aspects such as power consumption, computation time, etc. to solve problems in computer science and more.
   
##### 2. Computer Structures and Systems
   : I am interested in AI accelerators such as GPUs and NPUs, as well as building reliable systems for next-generation processors.
